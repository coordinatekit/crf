/**
 * The built-in {@link org.coordinatekit.crf.core.feature.configuration.FeatureExtractorFactory
 * factories} a configuration can name out of the box.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each factory wraps an extractor from {@code org.coordinatekit.crf.core.feature} and is registered
 * through {@code META-INF/services} so it is discovered by
 * {@link org.coordinatekit.crf.core.feature.configuration.FeatureExtractorFactoryRegistry#load()}.
 * The catalog spans the composing extractors — {@code composite} and {@code window} — and the leaf
 * extractors: {@code prefix}, {@code suffix}, {@code length}, {@code lookup}, {@code pattern},
 * {@code position}, and {@code sequenceLength}.
